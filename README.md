## Capture the flag

### What is capture the flag?
Capture the Flag (CTF) is an event where you need to find hidden flags (in this case, strings) within an application. 
We have intentionally hidden these flags in vulnerable parts of this application for you to discover.

### The format
We have hidden 8 different flags throughout the app.
Depending on the difficulty of each flag, you will be rewarded with N words per flag, which will eventually form a complete sentence when you collect them all.
When u found a specific flag, Please send this to Mark/Menno and they will give u the words based on the difficulty.

### tools

### Rules
- Have fun
- Please do not Command/shift/F for specific strings
- U are not allowed to check the database, u can only retrieve data by hacking
- U are not allowed to check the seeders -> we will ask specific questions when retrieving stuff from the database.
- Dont ask Chatgpt for answers, use it to exploit your brain ( or just dont use it )
- Internet is allowed, this is purely for fun and to learn, it is oke to read security articles and exploits, we encourage this.
